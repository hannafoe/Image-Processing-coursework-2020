# Overview
In this project I created images with different effects.
- 1: Creating a light leak effect and a rainbow light leak
- 2: Creating a salt and pepper noise texture for the monochrome pencil effect and for a coloured pencil effect
- 3: Implementing the gaussian blur function to smooth the features of the face
- 4: Creating a swirl in the middle of the image
